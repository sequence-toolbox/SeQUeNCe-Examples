### Starlight Experiments
Code for the experiments performed in our paper can be found in the file `starlight_experiments.py`. This script uses the `starlight.json` file (also within the example folder) to specify the network topology.

### Jupyter Notebook Examples
The example folder contains several scripts that can be run with jupyter notebook for easy editing and visualization. These examples include:
* `BB84_eg.ipynb`, which uses the BB84 protocol to distribute secure keys between two quantum nodes
* `two_node_eg.ipynb`, which performs entanglement generation between two adjacent quantum routers
* `three_node_eg_ep_es.ipynb`, which performs entanglement generation, purification, and swapping for a linear network of three quantum routers

## Additional Tools

### Network Visualization
The example directory contains an example json file `starlight.json` to specify a network topology, and the utils directory contains the script `draw_topo.py` to visualize json files. To use this script, the Graphviz library must be installed. Installation information can be found on the [Graphviz website](https://www.graphviz.org/download/).

To view a network, simply run the script and specify the relative location of your json file:
```
python utils/draw_topo.py example/starlight.json
```
This script also supports a flag `-m` to visualize BSM nodes created by default on quantum links between routers.
